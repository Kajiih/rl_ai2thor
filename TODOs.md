# TODOs and in coming features

## Possible features

- Add falling back on closest object to the agent if no object at the target coordinates
- Add falling back on closest object in the agent's field of view if no object at the target coordinates
- If no object is at the target object coordinates, add range around the coordinates to search for the object
- Add continuous/discrete dichotomy for some action groups only
- Add 3rd party/external camera
- Add enabling or disabling object properties from config (`openable`, `pickupable`, `receptacle`, ...)
- Add switching from on and off toggle actions to single toggle action from config

## TODOs

### Dev TODOs

- [x] Test enabling cloud rendering from config
- [ ] Test with the `startx.py` script and add it to the README if necessary
- [ ] Create a docker image to simplify the Xorg setup

- [ ] Add indirect candidate requirement for certain item prop (`water_source` necessary when `dirty=True`). Eventually make it at the same time than adding intermediate goals (toggling a `water_source`)
  - [ ] `VISIBLE` -> some dense reward function of the distance to the object and the angle to the object in the field of view
  - [x] `IS_TOGGLED` -> None
  - [x] `IS_BROKEN` -> ~~None?~~ Pick up?
  - [x] `IS_FILLED_WITH_LIQUID` -> toggle a `water_source`?
  - [ ] `FILL_LIQUID` -> IS_FILLED_WITH_LIQUID
  - [x] `IS_DIRTY` -> toggle `water_source` if `IS_DIRTY=True`? else **not** possible
  - [x] `IS_USED_UP` -> None
  - [x] `IS_COOKED` -> toggle and/or open a compatible `cooking_source`? and pick up the `cooked` item?
  - [x] `TEMPERATURE` -> toggle and/or open a compatible `heat_source` if `HOT` or `cold_source` if `COLD`?
  - [x] `IS_SLICED` -> pickup `knife`
  - [x] `IS_OPEN` -> None
  - [x] `OPENNESS` -> None
  - [x] `IS_PICKED_UP` -> None
  - Nothing needed for fixed properties
  - The new auxiliary items generated by the intermediate goals can overlap with the original items (one candidate can work for several)
  - [ ] Add indirect candidate requirement for certain relations
    - [ ] `RECEPTACLE_OF` -> open the receptacle if it is closed in the beginning
    - [x] `CONTAINED_IN` -> None
    - [x] `CLOSE_TO` -> None
  - [ ] Add other indirect intermediate tasks (like the need to open a container if the all the candidates for an item are in the container)
- [ ] Implement contextual interactions for auxiliary goals (liquid fill (coffee with coffee machine...), cooking (bread slice in toaster...), heating (mug in coffee machine...), slicing (breaking) eggs without knife)
- [ ] Intermediate/auxiliary goals with custom property satisfaction function being: the goal auxiliary goal is satisfied OR the main goal is satisfied (property satisfied or relation satisfied)
  - [x] Implement auxiliary properties for properties
  - [x] Implement auxiliary items for properties
  - [x] Implement auxiliary properties for relations
  - [ ] Implement complex auxiliary properties (e.g. you need to open the microwave then put potato in then close the microwave then toggle the microwave to cook the potato...)

- [ ] Support slicing objects (`objectType` changes when slicing)
- [ ] Support different liquids (coffee for mugs)
- [ ] Implement a task parser for dictionary that takes a dictionary defining a task with strings and return the correct task dictionary

- [x] In TaskItem class, separate FixedItemProp which are used only as candidate required property and the variable props which are used only for advancement computation
- [x] Same with specific TaskItems for auxiliary items
- [x] Same with specific ItemProp for auxiliary prop
- [x] Use a NewType for candidate id
- [x] Stop using generic type [T] in TaskItem

- [ ] Implement a more general item prop class that doesn't directly depend on an ai2thor object's property
- [x] Change `OBJECT_TYPES_DATA` to be a dataclass
- [x] Delete the main and related item information from the relations initialization
- [ ] Implement a way to define tasks directly from config with task dictionaries
- [ ] Add an order to item properties and relations (only properties?) so that the agent doesn't receive reward for a property of order n if all properties of orders n-1 of the item are not satisfied
- [ ] Implement the fact that relations count only if the all properties of both items are satisfied (both in the task advancement and the computation of the task advancement bounds)
- [ ] Change name of the project and package to RL THOR or THORRL?
- [ ] Make compatible with python 3.11 (and 3.10?) and update README installation part
- [x] Add Gymnasium interface
- [x] Create iTHOR environment class

- [ ] Refactor envs.tasks.tasks.py by using only item ids as dictionary key instead of sometimes the ids and sometimes the item itself
- [x] Refactor results and scores in envs.tasks.tasks.py to use 2 different dicts for relations and properties instead of 1 common dict to simplify types
- [ ] Add checking if actions are compatible with each other
  - [ ] Can't be 100% accurate, but we can do some checks (e.g.`hand_movements` implies `pickup`, ...)
